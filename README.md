# Aisle Optimizer

This project has been designed for educational purposes.

So, Why this project ?

The creation of a very simple side project, which responds to my need and a desire for learning. 
The aim of this project is manifold:  
 1. Manage the creation of a personal project from A to Z (From logo to deployment as a CEO)
 2. Learn how to manipulate the OpenAI API. 
 3. Code with Real TDD, not only Test-First approach
 4. Testing tools and libs (i.e: husky)  
 5. A need to take less time in my favorite mall.

By spending as little time as possible in a shopping center, you also reduce the temptation to 
compulsively buy products that are not on the shopping list.
Save time + Money, I love it ! 

## Budget
No budget has been allocated to this project, apart from the running costs.

## The Name
The name of the project was suggested by chatGPT and reflects shopping in a mall in the most efficient
way possible to spend the least amount of time there.

## The Logo
The logo had to meet the following 3 criteria: 
1- Reflect an image of efficiency
2- Recognize that it's about shopping
3- Identify the money you can save

It's far from perfect, and it's not a real PNG, but it'll be ok for the usage.

## More Features

I haven't made a roadmap for this project, but I have a few ideas for future features: 
- Store invoices to analyze expenses
- Highlight whether the budget has been respected
- Show the purchase of products that weren't on the list
- Add visualization curves 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
